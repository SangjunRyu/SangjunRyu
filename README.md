# 🚀 Featured Project: Clinical Search Data Pipeline

**Lambda Architecture | Kafka → Spark → S3 → PostgreSQL**

Repository:  
https://github.com/SangjunRyu/clinical-search-data-pipeline

---

## Overview

Designed and implemented an **end-to-end Lambda Architecture data pipeline** processing over **5.2M clinical search log events** (TripClick dataset).

The system combines:

- 📦 **Batch layer** for daily, consistent analytics (T+1)
- ⚡ **Speed layer** for near real-time dashboards (5-minute micro-batch)
- ♻️ **Immutable raw storage** for replay and reprocessing
- 🐳 Fully containerized distributed infrastructure (Docker-based)

This project simulates a production-style hybrid architecture used in real-world data platforms.


## High-Level Architecture

### Ingestion
Web Servers → Kafka (Event Streaming)

### Batch Layer (Accuracy)
Kafka → S3 (Archive Raw) → Spark ETL → PostgreSQL (Batch Marts)

### Speed Layer (Low Latency)
Kafka → Spark Structured Streaming → PostgreSQL (Realtime Marts)

### Serving
PostgreSQL → Apache Superset Dashboards

### Orchestration
Apache Airflow (Pipeline Automation & Scheduling)
